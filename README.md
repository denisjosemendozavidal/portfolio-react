# My Portfolio.

Deployment: https://portfolio-denis-mendoza.netlify.app/

Welcome to my portfolio, with this readme I intend to explain a little bit about, starting with the languages,the idea or concept behind it and the structure of it. 

Let’s begging:

The language used on it was React.js

The concept: I went for an easy to understand and visually attractive  interface. 

The Structure:

We begin with a selfie of mine and a greeting just stating my name. In this greeting words change as the user hover or tabs on them, (depending on the device), leading to links to other pages or feeding changes to the website itself. 
Changes are: 

If the user clicks on "Hi!" it gets redirected to the About me page. Here, users can just read the summary and get all the most important information or they can scroll down where an introductory video will be waiting along with more in depth information about myself.

If the user clicks on "I'm" result will be that the selfie disappears and in its place a section showing my most important projects show up. 

If the user clicks on "Denis" they get to download my CV in PDF format. 

If the user clicks on the "Peace sign" they get to see links to my social media. 

Hope this read me was useful, feel free to reach out if you have further questions. 

Thank you.
